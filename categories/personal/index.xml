      <description>After some difficult time without much ideas about how to write, and what to write about, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to review this blog. Many things have happened since I&amp;rsquo;ve last time update this page: new Machine Learning courses, participation in the AIMS2 program preparation, first time teaching of the M2 Econometrics course and many more. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to describe some of my new ideas concerning this blog&amp;rsquo;s past and future.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s highly probable, that the days to come will be marked with a lot of activity on this blog. Some of the last discussions pushed me forward to start publishing on several topics I&amp;rsquo;ve considered as not worth of it. Among the most interesting points comes the discussion of the R related ecosystem. This topic regroups both the discussion about the FOS Software, as well as the R language itself.</description>

      <title>Bikes in Grenoble</title>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a break from the technical publications about R and informatics in general. This is mostly because I was distracted by a more immediate problems: the choice of a bike for this academic year. My contract with the Metrovelo, the most popular bike-rental company in Grenoble, has expired around 10-th september, pushing me to reconsider my travel choices.
In Grenoble, as in many other european towns, the transportation choices are more versatile than in Moscow, or any northern cities in general.</description>

      <title>Gift ideas for FOSS enthusiasts</title>

      <description>Personally I have rather mixed feeling towards the wishlists. Even though having a list of gifts is convenient, it somewhat reduces the joy. However, after some recent discussions I&amp;rsquo;ve realised that probably creating some sort of wishlist may be not such a bad idea. But making this &amp;ldquo;wishlist&amp;rdquo; useful for some other people may be an even better idea.
So, what can be interesting for people who adore gadgets and tinkering, preferring at the same time to stick with some Open Source solutions?</description>

      <description>My name is Nikita Gusarov and I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing my Doctoral studies at the University Grenoble Alpes located in France.
 My work is primarily focused on exploration of the performances of Discrete Choice Models (DCM) in modelling individual behaviour. This is a rather breathtaking topic, because of its interdisciplinary nature. I have to deal at the same time with different techniques from quite distant fields, among which:
 Statistics Econometrics Machine Learning Combinatorics and Optimisation  As well as various behavioural theories, specific for several domains:</description>
