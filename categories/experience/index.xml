      <description>Some while ago I had an interesting discussion concerning the different approaches to workflow organisation and learning. It happened around at the same time, that I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered the Vimium browser extension. This coincidence lead me to write this blog-post about the workflow organisation and usage of shortcuts in everyday life. To keep the content simple, I&amp;rsquo;ll start with some general ideas on using shortcuts and then present some advantages of using their Vim-style version.</description>

      <description>In this part, we are finally approaching one of the most important and interesting topics, when creating a website: the deployment process. I do not believe that this will be the end of the sequence about the websites, because there are some more interesting topics. Among them:
 RSS (Really Simple Syndication) configuration Templates Custom layouts Java Script (JS) embedding Synchronisation Migration And many more  But let&amp;rsquo;s leave these topics for later and focus our attention on the deployment procedure.</description>

      <description>So, this post continues the sequence about building a website with R software. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll make focus on the building procedure with the help of previously chosen solution: blogdown.
Site generation with blogdown The procedure of building website with blogdown may be divided into several steps:
 Dependencies installation Theme choice and file-structure generation Building website  Installation As it was stated before, the blogdown package uses Hugo backend to build websites.</description>

      <description>The idea to write this post (or rather a sequence of posts) appeared when I was attempting to deploy this website, mostly because of the difficulties I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered. So, today&amp;rsquo;s question is: how to deploy a simple static website with R?
First of all, we should start with distinguishing two main steps in website production:
 Building website Deploying the results on the web  These two topics may be rather long to explain, that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;d rather prefer to separate this post into several parts.</description>

      <description>Today’s’ experience with helping to submit an article for a journal of Taylor &amp;amp; Francis group was educative and energy draining at the same time. Yesterday was quite a long day dedicated to styling the document, while now I had only figures to worry about. Later, I’ll definitely have to write some guide about academic writing and how R software, which can be useful in this aspect. But now lets speak about some useful tips in using tikz.</description>
