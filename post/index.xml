      <description>The third year of my PhD is arriving at it&amp;rsquo;s end and now all my forces are focused on the final manuscript writing, alongside with several side projects (done in collaboration with other PhD students). My experience of updating the blog on everyday basis at the start of February 2022 was more distracting from the work than I though, although it helped to keep the writing-oriented state of mind. This time, in order to boost my writing productivity I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to return here more often with work related and personal updates.</description>

      <description>It seems that I&amp;rsquo;ve taken quite a long time since the last post to return here. Such a long pause is mainly explained by my work on the thesis and participation in the Discrete Choice Analysis (DCA) school organised at EPFL. Probably I should make some posts with a more academic content, but it&amp;rsquo;s something for future projects.
Today I wanted to document the procedure for updating a Coreboot firmware on my X220.</description>

      <description>Today there&amp;rsquo;ll be no big theoretical posts about the advanced R. However, as I don&amp;rsquo;t want to drop my new habit to write a post per day, I&amp;rsquo;ll publish at least something.
Here I&amp;rsquo;ll gather some useful tricks I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered while rebuilding the simulation package.
A short introduction to my current work From my previous posts you probably already know that now I&amp;rsquo;m revising the custom simulation package, which is used in my thesis.</description>

      <description>While reworking the DCE Simulation package for my Thesis, I’ve discovered one more interesting topic to speak about. We have already seen how to create a package, write documentation and implement OOP in R. Now it comes the time of Metaprogramming. But don’t be afraid of this unfamiliar term, we are going to see that the concepts behind it are fairly simple.
Most of the materials presented are adopted from this mazing book about advanced R.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to break my streak of posts about R programming language, to write something more personal. This autumn, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a Pinephone for my birthday to tinker with and which had some software issues present at that time. About the same time I&amp;rsquo;ve deGoogled another old home to use with Lineage OS. So it was only in December that I managed to switch over to using my Pinephone for some time.</description>

      <description>In previous publications we have seen how to create a package with R: (1) the project’s structure generation, (2) the unit tests and their automation and (3) the documentation management. Now its time to dive deeper into programming with R. Today we are going to explore how one can use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm in R.
There exist multiple object types and programming conventions, each with a particular idea behind it.</description>

      <description>Previously we have seen how to create a package: how to structure your code, what files to include and how to test your code. The next step in package creation is the documentation. We have spoken about its existence, but only briefly. Now we have some more time to describe the documentation mantainace procedure more in detail. For this we are going to use the roxygen2 package, which is included in devtool suite.</description>

      <description>Following the previous post about the package creation in R we are going to dive into some details about how to work with packages. The first thing of interest for us is the possibility to perform tests on the package’s contents in order to control the result. Such possibility greatly facilitates the workflow while creating a package and ensures its functionality.
What is testthat? Focusing our attention on the devtools meta-package’s contents we encounter rather quickly a great number of tools to test packages.</description>

      <description>Some days ago I&amp;rsquo;ve started to revise the code of one particular R package I&amp;rsquo;m using in my thesis work. This is a particular package developed by our team and implemented by one of my friends - Antoine Dubois. The main idea behind the implemented toolset is the simulation of individual behaviour under the most popular behavioural models. The final product should simplify the model pen-testing and performance evaluation tasks for economists and experimentalists.</description>

      <description>While working on my PhD thesis I’m usually facing the situation when I need to use both R and Python programming languages. R offers me the possibility to render neat scientific supports with rmarkdown package, which bring .Rmd support. Obviously, Python has similar format (pymarkdown and the .Pmd) available, it is not as well developed as the R counterpart. Moreover, I’m far more familiar with R statistical libraries, tidyverse suite and coding practices.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;ve had to complete one of the course deliverables with some indications about how to compile the .Rmd files. The courses I&amp;rsquo;m giving (partially) at Grenoble INP Génie Industriel (GI) are mostly oriented for the first and second year students on the engineering track. This means that the level of heterogeneity in the knowledge across the groups is extreme and while some of them are more than capable to use R for document compilation, others encounter difficulties with this task.</description>

      <description>Continuing the posts&#39; streak, today we are going to see how to eliminate the PWM flickering problem that arises on some of the ThinkPad laptops of early 2010-th. The proposed solution is specific for the laptops equipped with Intel GPU&amp;rsquo;s (Intel i915 only) running Linux.
This summer I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired a second laptop, an old ThinkPad X220, to have something more portable at hand in complement to my main ThinkPad T430. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to finally patch my X220, because with time the eye strain has become more and more noticeable.</description>

      <description>Recently I’ve became obsessed with the idea of getting into stock exchange (for testing purposes and not for actual investment). One of the main reasons is the desire to start putting something aside for long-term perspective, but in short perspective this project gives me quite a lot of things to play with. Among them - the possibility to explore the predictive financial oriented models, neural networks (NN) testing for stock predictions and many more.</description>

      <description>Since the start of my Doctoral studies I’ve always performed the literature exploration “the hard way”. Meaning, that I’ve performed most of my literature searches by hand, attempting to manually locate the key articles in the domain. While I’ve got an in-depth comprehension of the field, it remains possible that I’ve overlooked some of interesting literature clusters. However, there always existed a possibility to avoid such mistakes: by performing a thorough bibliometrics study instead of the simple literature overview.</description>

      <description>Some days ago I&amp;rsquo;ve descried my new password management model, where I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned a tool named pass. By the end of the year 2021 I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this tool for some time for my passwords management, while in 2022 it became more of a fallback measure for my backups and secure password storage. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss some of the features of this tool, as well as my personal setup and use-case.</description>

      <description>Today we are going to speak about the self-hosting. Since the start of January I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some time on configuration of my home server for my personal applications. The idea behind this transition was to put some more distance between myself and my dependence on the external services, where I&amp;rsquo;ve no means to control my personal data. The last year, I&amp;rsquo;ve already performed the transition from using the Google Drive and Dropbox to the usage of more private NextCloud solutions (offered by my university,as well as a privacy respecting server in Zurich).</description>

      <description>After receiving a hardware authentication token for the New Year, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite a lot of time on the configuration. Even though I&amp;rsquo;d already modified my security model by the end of 2021, I needed to reconsider it once again. Now my password management framework comprises three elements:
 Hardware security token (OnlyKey) for most sensitive credentials and 2FA (two facto authentication like OTP, FIDO2 / U2F) Self-hosted cloud storage (Vaultwarden) for less sensitive credential Encrypted password database (Pass-Tomb) on a USB  Each of these elements requires a separate post, but for now I&amp;rsquo;ll focus only on the first part.</description>

      <description>After some difficult time without much ideas about how to write, and what to write about, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to review this blog. Many things have happened since I&amp;rsquo;ve last time update this page: new Machine Learning courses, participation in the AIMS2 program preparation, first time teaching of the M2 Econometrics course and many more. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to describe some of my new ideas concerning this blog&amp;rsquo;s past and future.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s highly probable, that the days to come will be marked with a lot of activity on this blog. Some of the last discussions pushed me forward to start publishing on several topics I&amp;rsquo;ve considered as not worth of it. Among the most interesting points comes the discussion of the R related ecosystem. This topic regroups both the discussion about the FOS Software, as well as the R language itself.</description>

      <description>Some while ago I had an interesting discussion concerning the different approaches to workflow organisation and learning. It happened around at the same time, that I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered the Vimium browser extension. This coincidence lead me to write this blog-post about the workflow organisation and usage of shortcuts in everyday life. To keep the content simple, I&amp;rsquo;ll start with some general ideas on using shortcuts and then present some advantages of using their Vim-style version.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a break from the technical publications about R and informatics in general. This is mostly because I was distracted by a more immediate problems: the choice of a bike for this academic year. My contract with the Metrovelo, the most popular bike-rental company in Grenoble, has expired around 10-th september, pushing me to reconsider my travel choices.
In Grenoble, as in many other european towns, the transportation choices are more versatile than in Moscow, or any northern cities in general.</description>

      <guid>https://nikitagusarov.github.io/post/2021-09-10-wishlist/</guid>
      <description>Personally I have rather mixed feeling towards the wishlists. Even though having a list of gifts is convenient, it somewhat reduces the joy. However, after some recent discussions I&amp;rsquo;ve realised that probably creating some sort of wishlist may be not such a bad idea. But making this &amp;ldquo;wishlist&amp;rdquo; useful for some other people may be an even better idea.
So, what can be interesting for people who adore gadgets and tinkering, preferring at the same time to stick with some Open Source solutions?</description>

      <description>In this part, we are finally approaching one of the most important and interesting topics, when creating a website: the deployment process. I do not believe that this will be the end of the sequence about the websites, because there are some more interesting topics. Among them:
 RSS (Really Simple Syndication) configuration Templates Custom layouts Java Script (JS) embedding Synchronisation Migration And many more  But let&amp;rsquo;s leave these topics for later and focus our attention on the deployment procedure.</description>

      <description>So, this post continues the sequence about building a website with R software. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll make focus on the building procedure with the help of previously chosen solution: blogdown.
Site generation with blogdown The procedure of building website with blogdown may be divided into several steps:
 Dependencies installation Theme choice and file-structure generation Building website  Installation As it was stated before, the blogdown package uses Hugo backend to build websites.</description>

      <description>The idea to write this post (or rather a sequence of posts) appeared when I was attempting to deploy this website, mostly because of the difficulties I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered. So, today&amp;rsquo;s question is: how to deploy a simple static website with R?
First of all, we should start with distinguishing two main steps in website production:
 Building website Deploying the results on the web  These two topics may be rather long to explain, that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;d rather prefer to separate this post into several parts.</description>

      <description>Today’s’ experience with helping to submit an article for a journal of Taylor &amp;amp; Francis group was educative and energy draining at the same time. Yesterday was quite a long day dedicated to styling the document, while now I had only figures to worry about. Later, I’ll definitely have to write some guide about academic writing and how R software, which can be useful in this aspect. But now lets speak about some useful tips in using tikz.</description>
