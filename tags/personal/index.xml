      <description>The third year of my PhD is arriving at it&amp;rsquo;s end and now all my forces are focused on the final manuscript writing, alongside with several side projects (done in collaboration with other PhD students). My experience of updating the blog on everyday basis at the start of February 2022 was more distracting from the work than I though, although it helped to keep the writing-oriented state of mind. This time, in order to boost my writing productivity I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to return here more often with work related and personal updates.</description>

      <description>After some difficult time without much ideas about how to write, and what to write about, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to review this blog. Many things have happened since I&amp;rsquo;ve last time update this page: new Machine Learning courses, participation in the AIMS2 program preparation, first time teaching of the M2 Econometrics course and many more. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to describe some of my new ideas concerning this blog&amp;rsquo;s past and future.</description>
