      Since the start of my Doctoral studies I’ve always performed the literature exploration “the hard way”. Meaning, that I’ve performed most of my literature searches by hand, attempting to manually locate the key articles in the domain. While I’ve got an in-depth comprehension of the field, it remains possible that I’ve overlooked some of interesting literature clusters. However, there always existed a possibility to avoid such mistakes: by performing a thorough bibliometrics study instead of the simple literature overview.

      In this part, we are finally approaching one of the most important and interesting topics, when creating a website: the deployment process. I do not believe that this will be the end of the sequence about the websites, because there are some more interesting topics. Among them:
 RSS (Really Simple Syndication) configuration Templates Custom layouts Java Script (JS) embedding Synchronisation Migration And many more  But let&rsquo;s leave these topics for later and focus our attention on the deployment procedure.

      So, this post continues the sequence about building a website with R software. Today I&rsquo;ll make focus on the building procedure with the help of previously chosen solution: blogdown.
Site generation with blogdown The procedure of building website with blogdown may be divided into several steps:
 Dependencies installation Theme choice and file-structure generation Building website  Installation As it was stated before, the blogdown package uses Hugo backend to build websites.

      The idea to write this post (or rather a sequence of posts) appeared when I was attempting to deploy this website, mostly because of the difficulties I&rsquo;ve encountered. So, today&rsquo;s question is: how to deploy a simple static website with R?
First of all, we should start with distinguishing two main steps in website production:
 Building website Deploying the results on the web  These two topics may be rather long to explain, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;d rather prefer to separate this post into several parts.

      Following the previous post about the package creation in R we are going to dive into some details about how to work with packages. The first thing of interest for us is the possibility to perform tests on the package’s contents in order to control the result. Such possibility greatly facilitates the workflow while creating a package and ensures its functionality.
What is testthat? Focusing our attention on the devtools meta-package’s contents we encounter rather quickly a great number of tools to test packages.

      Some days ago I&rsquo;ve started to revise the code of one particular R package I&rsquo;m using in my thesis work. This is a particular package developed by our team and implemented by one of my friends - Antoine Dubois. The main idea behind the implemented toolset is the simulation of individual behaviour under the most popular behavioural models. The final product should simplify the model pen-testing and performance evaluation tasks for economists and experimentalists.

      Previously we have seen how to create a package: how to structure your code, what files to include and how to test your code. The next step in package creation is the documentation. We have spoken about its existence, but only briefly. Now we have some more time to describe the documentation mantainace procedure more in detail. For this we are going to use the roxygen2 package, which is included in devtool suite.

      Recently I’ve became obsessed with the idea of getting into stock exchange (for testing purposes and not for actual investment). One of the main reasons is the desire to start putting something aside for long-term perspective, but in short perspective this project gives me quite a lot of things to play with. Among them - the possibility to explore the predictive financial oriented models, neural networks (NN) testing for stock predictions and many more.

Some of the last discussions pushed me forward to start publishing on several topics I&rsquo;ve considered as not worth of it.

      Some while ago I had an interesting discussion concerning the different approaches to workflow organisation and learning. It happened around at the same time, that I&rsquo;ve discovered the Vimium browser extension. This coincidence lead me to write this blog-post about the workflow organisation and usage of shortcuts in everyday life. To keep the content simple, I&rsquo;ll start with some general ideas on using shortcuts and then present some advantages of using their Vim-style version.

But making this &ldquo;wishlist&rdquo; useful for some other people may be an even better idea.
So, what can be interesting for people who adore gadgets and tinkering, preferring at the same time to stick with some Open Source solutions?

The courses I&rsquo;m giving (partially) at Grenoble INP Génie Industriel (GI) are mostly oriented for the first and second year students on the engineering track. This means that the level of heterogeneity in the knowledge across the groups is extreme and while some of them are more than capable to use R for document compilation, others encounter difficulties with this task.

This summer I&rsquo;ve acquired a second laptop, an old ThinkPad X220, to have something more portable at hand in complement to my main ThinkPad T430. Today I&rsquo;ve decided to finally patch my X220, because with time the eye strain has become more and more noticeable.

One of the main reasons is the desire to start putting something aside for long-term perspective, but in short perspective this project gives me quite a lot of things to play with. Among them - the possibility to explore the predictive financial oriented models, neural networks (NN) testing for stock predictions and many more.

      Since the start of my Doctoral studies I’ve always performed the literature exploration “the hard way”. Meaning, that I’ve performed most of my literature searches by hand, attempting to manually locate the key articles in the domain. While I’ve got an in-depth comprehension of the field, it remains possible that I’ve overlooked some of interesting literature clusters. However, there always existed a possibility to avoid such mistakes: by performing a thorough bibliometrics study instead of the simple literature overview.

 Hardware security token (OnlyKey) for most sensitive credentials and 2FA (two facto authentication like OTP, FIDO2 / U2F) Self-hosted cloud storage (Vaultwarden) for less sensitive credential Encrypted password database (Pass-Tomb) on a USB  Each of these elements requires a separate post, but for now I&rsquo;ll focus only on the first part.

Obviously, Python has similar format (pymarkdown and the .Pmd) available, it is not as well developed as the R counterpart. Moreover, I’m far more familiar with R statistical libraries, tidyverse suite and coding practices.

This means that the level of heterogeneity in the knowledge across the groups is extreme and while some of them are more than capable to use R for document compilation, others encounter difficulties with this task.

What is testthat? Focusing our attention on the devtools meta-package’s contents we encounter rather quickly a great number of tools to test packages.

This summer I&rsquo;ve acquired a second laptop, an old ThinkPad X220, to have something more portable at hand in complement to my main ThinkPad T430. Today I&rsquo;ve decided to finally patch my X220, because with time the eye strain has become more and more noticeable.

This means that the level of heterogeneity in the knowledge across the groups is extreme and while some of them are more than capable to use R for document compilation, others encounter difficulties with this task.

      While working on my PhD thesis I’m usually facing the situation when I need to use both R and Python programming languages. R offers me the possibility to render neat scientific supports with rmarkdown package, which bring .Rmd support. Obviously, Python has similar format (pymarkdown and the .Pmd) available, it is not as well developed as the R counterpart. Moreover, I’m far more familiar with R statistical libraries, tidyverse suite and coding practices.

      After some difficult time without much ideas about how to write, and what to write about, I&rsquo;ve decided to review this blog. Many things have happened since I&rsquo;ve last time update this page: new Machine Learning courses, participation in the AIMS2 program preparation, first time teaching of the M2 Econometrics course and many more. In this post I&rsquo;ll attempt to describe some of my new ideas concerning this blog&rsquo;s past and future.

      It&rsquo;s highly probable, that the days to come will be marked with a lot of activity on this blog. Some of the last discussions pushed me forward to start publishing on several topics I&rsquo;ve considered as not worth of it. Among the most interesting points comes the discussion of the R related ecosystem. This topic regroups both the discussion about the FOS Software, as well as the R language itself.

      In this part, we are finally approaching one of the most important and interesting topics, when creating a website: the deployment process. I do not believe that this will be the end of the sequence about the websites, because there are some more interesting topics. Among them:
 RSS (Really Simple Syndication) configuration Templates Custom layouts Java Script (JS) embedding Synchronisation Migration And many more  But let&rsquo;s leave these topics for later and focus our attention on the deployment procedure.

      So, this post continues the sequence about building a website with R software. Today I&rsquo;ll make focus on the building procedure with the help of previously chosen solution: blogdown.
Site generation with blogdown The procedure of building website with blogdown may be divided into several steps:
 Dependencies installation Theme choice and file-structure generation Building website  Installation As it was stated before, the blogdown package uses Hugo backend to build websites.

      The idea to write this post (or rather a sequence of posts) appeared when I was attempting to deploy this website, mostly because of the difficulties I&rsquo;ve encountered. So, today&rsquo;s question is: how to deploy a simple static website with R?
First of all, we should start with distinguishing two main steps in website production:
 Building website Deploying the results on the web  These two topics may be rather long to explain, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;d rather prefer to separate this post into several parts.

      Personally I have rather mixed feeling towards the wishlists. Even though having a list of gifts is convenient, it somewhat reduces the joy. However, after some recent discussions I&rsquo;ve realised that probably creating some sort of wishlist may be not such a bad idea. But making this &ldquo;wishlist&rdquo; useful for some other people may be an even better idea.
So, what can be interesting for people who adore gadgets and tinkering, preferring at the same time to stick with some Open Source solutions?
