      <description>Following the previous post about the package creation in R we are going to dive into some details about ho to work with packages. The first thing of interest for us is the possibility to perform tests on the package’s contents in order to control the result. Such possibility greatly facilitates the workflow while creating a package and ensures its functionality.
What is testthat? Focusing our attention on the devtools meta-package’s contents we encounter rather quickly a great number of tools to test packages.</description>

      <title>Python alongside R</title>

      <description>While working on my PhD thesis I’m usually facing the situation when I need to use both R and Python programming languages. R offers me the possibility to render neat scientific supports with rmarkdown package, which bring .Rmd support. Obviously, Python has similar format (pymarkdown and the .Pmd) available, it is not as well developed as the R counterpart. Moreover, I’m far more familiar with R statistical libraries, tidyverse suite and coding practices.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;ve had to complete one of the course deliverables with some indications about how to compile the .Rmd files. The courses I&amp;rsquo;m giving (partially) at Grenoble INP Génie Industriel (GI) are mostly oriented for the first and second year students on the engineering track. This means that the level of heterogeneity in the knowledge across the groups is extreme and while some of them are more than capable to use R for document compilation, others encounter difficulties with this task.</description>

      <description>Recently I’ve became obsessed with the idea of getting into stock exchange (for testing purposes and not for actual investment). One of the main reasons is the desire to start putting something aside for long-term perspective, but in short perspective this project gives me quite a lot of things to play with. Among them - the possibility to explore the predictive financial oriented models, neural networks (NN) testing for stock predictions and many more.</description>

      <description>Since the start of my Doctoral studies I’ve always performed the literature exploration “the hard way”. Meaning, that I’ve performed most of my literature searches by hand, attempting to manually locate the key articles in the domain. While I’ve got an in-depth comprehension of the field, it remains possible that I’ve overlooked some of interesting literature clusters. However, there always existed a possibility to avoid such mistakes: by performing a thorough bibliometrics study instead of the simple literature overview.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s highly probable, that the days to come will be marked with a lot of activity on this blog. Some of the last discussions pushed me forward to start publishing on several topics I&amp;rsquo;ve considered as not worth of it. Among the most interesting points comes the discussion of the R related ecosystem. This topic regroups both the discussion about the FOS Software, as well as the R language itself.</description>

      <title>Building a website (part 3)</title>

      <description>In this part, we are finally approaching one of the most important and interesting topics, when creating a website: the deployment process. I do not believe that this will be the end of the sequence about the websites, because there are some more interesting topics. Among them:
 RSS (Really Simple Syndication) configuration Templates Custom layouts Java Script (JS) embedding Synchronisation Migration And many more  But let&amp;rsquo;s leave these topics for later and focus our attention on the deployment procedure.</description>

      <description>So, this post continues the sequence about building a website with R software. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll make focus on the building procedure with the help of previously chosen solution: blogdown.
Site generation with blogdown The procedure of building website with blogdown may be divided into several steps:
 Dependencies installation Theme choice and file-structure generation Building website  Installation As it was stated before, the blogdown package uses Hugo backend to build websites.</description>

      <description>The idea to write this post (or rather a sequence of posts) appeared when I was attempting to deploy this website, mostly because of the difficulties I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered. So, today&amp;rsquo;s question is: how to deploy a simple static website with R?
First of all, we should start with distinguishing two main steps in website production:
 Building website Deploying the results on the web  These two topics may be rather long to explain, that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;d rather prefer to separate this post into several parts.</description>
