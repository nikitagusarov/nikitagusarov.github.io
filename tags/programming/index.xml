      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;ve to complete one of the course deliverables with some indications about how to compile the .Rmd files. The courses I&amp;rsquo;m giving (partially) at Grenoble INP Génie Industriel (GI) are mostly oriented for the first and second year students on the engineering track. This means that the level of heterogeneity in the knowledge across the groups is extreme and while some of them are more than capable to use R for document compilation, others encounter difficulties with this task.</description>

      <title>ThinkPad X220 and PWM</title>

      <description>Continuing the posts&#39; streak, today we are going to see how to eliminate the PWM flickering problem that arises on some of the ThinkPad laptops of early 2010-th. The proposed solution is specific for the laptops equipped with Intel GPU&amp;rsquo;s (Intel i915 only) running Linux.
This summer I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired a second laptop, an old ThinkPad X220, to have something more portable at hand in complement to my main ThinkPad T430. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to finally patch my X220, because with time the eye strain has become more and more noticeable.</description>

      <title>Financial market analysis with R</title>

      <description>Recently I’ve became obsessed with the idea of getting into stock exchange (for testing purposes and not for actual investment). One of the main reasons is the desire to start putting something aside for long-term perspective, but in short perspective this project gives me quite a lot of things to play with. Among them - the possibility to explore the predictive financial oriented models, neural networks (NN) testing for stock predictions and many more.</description>

      <description>Since the start of my Doctoral studies I’ve always performed the literature exploration “the hard way”. Meaning, that I’ve performed most of my literature searches by hand, attempting to manually locate the key articles in the domain. While I’ve got an in-depth comprehension of the field, it remains possible that I’ve overlooked some of interesting literature clusters. However, there always existed a possibility to avoid such mistakes: by performing a thorough bibliometrics study instead of the simple literature overview.</description>

      <title>`Pass` for password management</title>
      <link>https://nikitagusarov.github.io/post/2022-02-03-pass/</link>

      <description>Some days ago I&amp;rsquo;ve descried my new password management model, where I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned a tool named pass. By the end of the year 2021 I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this tool for some time for my passwords management, while in 2022 it became more of a fallback measure for my backups and secure password storage. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss some of the features of this tool, as well as my personal setup and use-case.</description>

      <title>Self-hosting</title>

      <description>Today we are going to speak about the self-hosting. Since the start of January I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some time on configuration of my home server for my personal applications. The idea behind this transition was to put some more distance between myself and my dependence on the external services, where I&amp;rsquo;ve no means to control my personal data. The last year, I&amp;rsquo;ve already performed the transition from using the Google Drive and Dropbox to the usage of more private NextCloud solutions (offered by my university,as well as a privacy respecting server in Zurich).</description>

      <title>OnlyKey for Linux login</title>
      <link>https://nikitagusarov.github.io/post/2022-01-29-onlykey-for-linux/</link>

      <description>After receiving a hardware authentication token for the New Year, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite a lot of time on the configuration. Even though I&amp;rsquo;d already modified my security model by the end of 2021, I needed to reconsider it once again. Now my password management framework comprises three elements:
 Hardware security token (OnlyKey) for most sensitive credentials and 2FA (two facto authentication like OTP, FIDO2 / U2F) Self-hosted cloud storage (Vaultwarden) for less sensitive credential Encrypted password database (Pass-Tomb) on a USB  Each of these elements requires a separate post, but for now I&amp;rsquo;ll focus only on the first part.</description>

      <title>RStudio or VS Code</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s highly probable, that the days to come will be marked with a lot of activity on this blog. Some of the last discussions pushed me forward to start publishing on several topics I&amp;rsquo;ve considered as not worth of it. Among the most interesting points comes the discussion of the R related ecosystem. This topic regroups both the discussion about the FOS Software, as well as the R language itself.</description>
