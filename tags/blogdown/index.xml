      <description>In this part, we are finally approaching one of the most important and interesting topics, when creating a website: the deployment process. I do not believe that this will be the end of the sequence about the websites, because there are some more interesting topics. Among them:
 RSS (Really Simple Syndication) configuration Templates Custom layouts Java Script (JS) embedding Synchronisation Migration And many more  But let&amp;rsquo;s leave these topics for later and focus our attention on the deployment procedure.</description>

 Dependencies installation Theme choice and file-structure generation Building website  Installation As it was stated before, the blogdown package uses Hugo backend to build websites.</description>

      <description>The idea to write this post (or rather a sequence of posts) appeared when I was attempting to deploy this website, mostly because of the difficulties I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered. So, today&amp;rsquo;s question is: how to deploy a simple static website with R?
First of all, we should start with distinguishing two main steps in website production:
 Building website Deploying the results on the web  These two topics may be rather long to explain, that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;d rather prefer to separate this post into several parts.</description>
