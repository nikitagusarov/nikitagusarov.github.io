      <description>Some while ago I had an interesting discussion concerning the different approaches to workflow organisation and learning. It happened around at the same time, that I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered the Vimium browser extension.

To keep the content simple, I&amp;rsquo;ll start with some general ideas on using shortcuts and then present some advantages of using their Vim-style version.</description>

      <description>Today’s’ experience with helping to submit an article for a journal of Taylor &amp;amp; Francis group was educative and energy draining at the same time. Yesterday was quite a long day dedicated to styling the document, while now I had only figures to worry about. Later, I’ll definitely have to write some guide about academic writing and how R software, which can be useful in this aspect. But now lets speak about some useful tips in using tikz.</description>
